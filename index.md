# Welcome!

Hi there! My name is Jack Bulson, I am currently a Computer Science student at University. I'll be graduating this year and I'm using this website to showcase my projects and creations.

I've been playing games all my life, and have always wanted to work in the games industry. I started programming when I was about 12, using GameMaker to create simple games. From then on, I went on to create lots of small games and even started creating simple mods for games such as Minecraft. 

In these past four years at university, I have gained a large amount of experience programming in C++, C#, GDScript and Java. For my third year I decided to specialise in video games, where I learned about how video games are programmed, as well as learning about graphics and physics within them. 

As part of the 4th year of my degree, I have also gained a large amount of experience in C++, creating a password encrypter & decrypter and programming the physics and gameplay behind a game inspired by Screwball Scramble. I have also utilised OpenGL to create a tropical island graphics scene. My results this year are:

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Programming for Games (100%)</li>
  <li>Advanced Graphics for Games (90%)</li>
  <li>Advanced Game Technologies (74%)</li>
  <li>Engineering Gaming Solutions within a Team (Yet to complete)</li>
  <li>Project and Dissertation for MCOMP (Yet to complete)</li>
  <li>Security Analysis of Complex Systems (Yet to complete)</li>
</ul>

Before this year, I had not really considered myself to have a specific interest within game development, except for Gameplay programming. However, after completing the Graphics for Games module, I've learnt a lot about renderers and rendering API and I found it really interesting to be able to actually understand how things are actually drawn to the screen. Currently, as part of the team project, I'm also working on the Graphics side for the team and I am in charge of expanding the functionality of the rendering code to not only run in OpenGL, but also in GNM for the PS4. Although I am open to all aspects of game development, I would love to be able to do find some work in Graphics.

If you want to hear more from me, make sure to follow me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/Bulson_Jack). I use this to post about any projects I'm working on and other things that I am pursuing.

# Welcome!

Hi there! My name is Jack Bulson, I am currently a Graduate Programmer at Sumo Digital. I'm using this website to showcase my projects and creations.

I've been playing games all my life, and have always wanted to work in the games industry. I started programming when I was about 12, using GameMaker to create simple games. From then on, I went on to create lots of small games and even started creating simple mods for games such as Minecraft. 

In my four years at university, I gained a large amount of experience programming in C++, C#, GDScript and Java. For my third year I decided to specialise in video games, where I learned about how video games are programmed, as well as learning about graphics and physics within them. 

I'm now working at Sumo Digital in Newcastle as a Graduate Programmer.

If you want to hear more from me, make sure to follow me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/Bulson_Jack). I use this to post about any projects I'm working on and other things that I am pursuing.

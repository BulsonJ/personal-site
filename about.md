# About page

Hi there! My name is Jack Bulson, I am currently a Computer Science student at University. I'll be graduating this year and I'm using this website to showcase my projects and creations.

I started programming when I was about 12, after I visited an after school club where we used GameMaker to create simple games. From then on, I went on to create lots of small games and even started creating simple mods for games such as Minecraft. 

In these past four years at university, I have gained a large amount of experience programming in C#,C++, GDScript and Java. In my third year I decided to specialise in video games, where I learned about how video games are programmed, as well as learning about graphics and physics within them. Recently, I have started to create my own projects to explore different areas of video games and challenge myself to learn even more.

If you want to hear more from me, make sure to follow me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/Bulson_Jack). I use this to post about any projects I'm working on and other things that I am pursuing.

Welcome to my website, and thank you for coming! It is a little bare bones right now, but I'm sure over the coming months I will be able to make it better.

To give you a bit of background on me, I am currently a Computer Science student at University. I'll be graduating this year and I'm using this website to showcase my projects and creations.

If you want to hear more from me, make sure to follow me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/Bulson_Jack).
